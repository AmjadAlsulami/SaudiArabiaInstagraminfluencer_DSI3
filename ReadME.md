# Capstone idea : Recommendation System for social media Influencers (Instagram) in Saudi Arabia

##  1. Problem Statement

Recently, social media and influencers have become a powerful and fast tool for marketing in Saudi Arabia.  However, Sometimes, companies and advertisers may turn to inappropriate influencers for their advertising campaign or may not reach the target segment of the campaign which may adversely affect them in terms of money loss or campaign failure. Also, they may think about one famous influencer(with high followers number), and they ignore hidden accounts with a great number of followers and also, high engagement rate.

## 2. Proposed Solution 
The recommendation system will use a dataset for social media influencers in Saudi Arabia (especially from Instagram). Currently, the system will be focused on the level of impact of influencers on Instagram compared with a suggested influencer by the user. The system will target those who want to advertise their advertising campaign or products from both large and emerging companies as well as governmental organizations in order to provide the best influencers in the field of the campaign (and to reach the targeted segments by comparing suggested influencer from their side to other influencers with best (high) engagement rate and low cost.

 ## 3. Conclosion:
 - It was not normal to project for me, I've selected the idea and find the best data available online to work on it. Fetch data by requesting the API was a challenge first for me also the knowing the properties of data and how it is calculated and the domain knowledge of the data was another hole journey. Cleaning numerical data first and how to remove rows without affecting data. 
- Moreover,  staring another cleaning part for finding new classification categories for influencer because there was a lack of categories that have been done using the full name and biography that are in a mixed language where there is a need to unify language by translating them using another library and API.
- Finally, applying clustering (which the result of it didn't use yet because I run of time (:). Also, using the pivot table with one numerical value engagement rate to fit the knn model and use distance to find another influencer in the same categories with a high engagement rate was my last step that needs to be improved.

## 4. Future work:
- With the use of these data, I will continue doing clustering and see the relation between the more than a category that influencer has. Also, build a recommendation system with the use of all numerical values(build specific matrix). 
- Also, I will back to my original idea where the input is categories output is the best influencers in that category.
- Also, I might use the Instagram API to get posts information for all influencers to know more things about these influences and do prediction and so on.
